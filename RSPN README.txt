RSPN Cave Systems 1.0

Installation:

Unzip "@RSPN" to Arma 3 ROOT. Start Arma and enable "RSPN Cave Systems 1.0".


Attention:

Cave segments do not have geometry on outside, be sure to cover all outside areas with covers or rocks! This includes connecting faces. Entrances DO have outside geometry, but only on smooth face not connecting face. Covers and insets have full geometry everywhere. Segment End_01 is very large with a heavy amount of geo, it is advised that this is not placed multiple times in a small area.

Editor Tips:

RSPN Caves can be found in the 2D and 3D editor under Empty> Objects (RSPN). When placing caves in editor, as caves require very precise placement in order to line up correctly, be sure that you save and double check line up after each segment placement.
