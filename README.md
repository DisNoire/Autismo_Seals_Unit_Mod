NOTE: ALL FILES HEREIN ARE HEAVILY WIP, EXPECT BUGS AND PLACEHOLDER ASSETS

While the developers have avoided using copyrighted assets, either as placeholders or as release assets, we acknowledge that some of our 3rd-party provided assets may be copyrighted without our knowledge. If you are the owner of copyrighted assets contained in this repository/addon, contact us for a swift removal.

Because of Github file size limits compiled PBOs are not included (for the most part) in this repository, you will have to compile them yourself if you wish to test the WIP addon.
